# Personal Bookmark Manager

Hi CodemyX team!
Here’s my submission for the task — a Personal Bookmark Manager web application that helps users organize and manage their bookmarks in a clean, intuitive interface.

## Features
- **View Bookmarks**: See all your saved bookmarks in a clean list or grid format.
- **Add Bookmarks**: Easily add new bookmarks with a title, URL, and category.
- **Edit Bookmarks**: Update existing bookmarks with new details.
- **Remove Bookmarks**: Delete bookmarks you no longer need.
- **Filter by Category**: Filter bookmarks based on categories or tags.
- **Search Bookmarks**: Search for bookmarks by title.
- **Sort Bookmarks**: Sort bookmarks by date or alphabetically.
- **Custom Categories**: Add your own categories for better organization.
- **Bookmark Validation**: Ensure URLs are valid before saving.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Switch between light and dark themes for a comfortable viewing experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that enhances JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom user interfaces.

## How to Run the Project Locally
- Ensure you have Node.js (v14.x or higher) installed.
- Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/034-BikashKumarYadav/bookmark-manager.git
- Navigate to the project directory:
   cd bookmark-manager
- Install dependencies:
   npm install

   npm run dev
- Open your browser and visit:
   http://localhost:3000

## Challenges I Faced
